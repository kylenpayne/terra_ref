# Terra Ref Consulting Project

## This is the github repository for the Stat 427 Consulting Project for the TerraRef (http://terraref.org/about/) project. This project aims to create a reference "phenome" for energy sorghum using high-throughput field sensors. Our team consulted the TerraRef computing and data team on prediction on forecasting ranking scores.
